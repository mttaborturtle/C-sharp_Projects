# My C-sharp_Projects

### This is the home repository for all of the C# projects from my Csharp.NET class at The Tech Academy. 

### There are quite a bit of projects in this repo. Here are some of the highlights:

- AskYourAge
- CarInsurance
- Casino/TwentyOneGame
- ExceptionHandling 
- FileWriter
- IterateMe
- MathApp
- MyNewsLetterMVC
- Scores
- income_comparison
- shipping_quote

### AskYourAge
```
This console app asks for your age and then tells you your birth year. 
It will throw special exemptions if improper input is given. 
```
### CarInsurance
```
This web-app is a fully functioning website that takes in a person's 
information and gives them a quote. Is uses .NET MVC to handle the 
information. There is a seperate Admin view that shows all quotes given.
```
### Casino/TwentyOneGame
```
This is one of my premier C# projects! I created a fully functioning
Blackjack console game. The Blackjack game lives in the Casino. In the 
future I will create more card games using the Casino Classes. This 
game is pretty fun and really feels like an actual game of Blackjack,
without pictures of the cards of course!
```
### ExceptionHandling 
```
This is a super simple console application that takes in some input and
handles any type of exception thrown. Run it and try to break it!
```
### FileWriter
```
This console app takes in a number and adds it to an external .txt file.
```
### IterateMe
```
This extensive console app does many different iterations to strings of 
different types. It was written during a long list of assignments.
```
### MathApp
```
This is another extensive console app written during a long list of assignments.
There are 5 different math functions performing a number of math operations.
```
### MyNewsLetterMVC
```
This is a .NET web application that allow a user to sign up to a newsletter.
Each time a user hits sign up a new database entry is made.
```
### Scores
```
Scores is a .NET application that references a .txt file and lists the student
scores and then gives an average score.
```
### income_comparison
```
This console app takes in some data fram an employee and calculates their pay
for the year.
```
### shipping_quote
```
This console app takes user input for the dimensions of a package then calculates
a quote. It handles exceptions in case a package is too big or heavy.
```

There are many other applications in the repository that are not listed here. Feel
